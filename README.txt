To compile the program on the UNT CELL machines, one can run the following:

g++ *.cpp *.h


When prompted to type the name of the config file, the config file must reside
within the same directory as the main.cpp file. This also applies to the
region file defined in the config file. Also, the region file name that is
defined in the config file must be the full path, such as below:

/nfs/home/STUDENTS/INSERT_EUID_HERE/csce2110/Project1/region.csv
